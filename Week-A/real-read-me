IT 483 submission for Week A.
Online-Class for the rest of the semester.

Questions and concerns -
As per this assignment, I've encountered the struggle of switching to online learning as compared to in person.
With that, I can't say this assignment is up par with what I would have liked to submit.
There are two main aspects of the assignment that stand out to me on what I hope to improve on in the next few weeks:
- General structure and Javascript coding. I haven't worked with Javescript before, so there was a large and at times frustrating learnining curve that took place.
- 'Submit' process -> When an error prone submission is sent, returned with the errors, fixed up, and then sent again, the code fails to update to the ACTION=".html" page. I am unsure how to fix this.
